# Binary Search Algorithm
Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It has a time complexity of O(log n), making it much faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets.

# How Binary Search Works
Sort the Array (Binary search only works on sorted arrays).
Find the Middle Element:
    If the middle element is the target, return its index.
    If the target is smaller, search the left half.
    If the target is larger, search the right half.
Repeat until the element is found or the search space is empty.
